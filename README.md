The main purpose of this study is to develop and design a system that monitors the pH level and temperature with dissolve oxygen control in an artificial aquatic system. 

The probes of the sensors in potential of Hydrogen (pH), D.O. and temperature were immersed inside the aquatic tank to monitor their values. Using experimental methods in testing the functionality of the different sensors, results show that the system was able to successfully monitor these factors. Information coming from the system such as the pH, dissolve oxygen and temperature readings were then displayed to an android mobile phone.

To control the levels of dissolve oxygen two valves were attached to the tank. Valve 1 serves as the intake valve where new water flows in the aquarium to restore new water with good quality until the water quality condition becomes stable and valve 2 as the discharge valve where acidic water can drain. When the acidity of the water reaches a reading of 6.4 or below the two valves open. Valve 2 flushes out the acidic water out of the tank and valve 1 replaces it with non-acidic water. When the acidity of the water reaches 6.5 up to 9.0, the two valves closes which signifies that acidity of water is normal. The pH reading was used to trigger the valve since most species cannot tolerate acidic water. Results shows that by replacing the water, not only the acidity was lowered but the dissolve oxygen content also was either maintained or increased.
